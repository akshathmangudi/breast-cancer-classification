Breast Cancer Classification

This notebook has been directly imported from my Kaggle profile, but I wrote the code in the notebook. 

Algorithms used: 
- Support Vector Machines
- Logistic Regression

This notebook goes from importing the dataset to preprocessing the data and finally, training the model for accuracy. 

I hope the code is understandable. 

Thank you.
